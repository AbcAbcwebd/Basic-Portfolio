				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img id="thumbnail" src="assets/images/OwenEssenChair.jpg" alt="Owen Essen looking cool, as always.">
				<p>
					Owen Essen is an amateur photographer from Chapel Hill, North 	Carolina. He has been taking photos since getting his first kiddie film camera as a toddler. He gained more sophisticated training in working with cameras while studying film and television at the Savannah College of Art and Design. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The photos on this site are from his recent trip to Europe to visit his sister Elia. Some of them were shot on a Canon 70D, others on an iPhone 5C. (See if you can guess which are which...)
