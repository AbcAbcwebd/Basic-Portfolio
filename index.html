	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>
		Owen Essen is an amateur photographer from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He’s been taking photos since getting his first kiddie film camera as a toddler. He gained more sophisticated training in working with cameras while studying film and television at the Savannah College of Art and Design.

	<p>
		The photos on this site are from his recent trip to Europe to visit his sister Elia. Some of them were shot on a Canon 70D, others on an iPhone 5C. (See if you can guess which are which….)
